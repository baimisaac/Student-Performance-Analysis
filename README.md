# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of student performance to identify factors influencing academic achievement. Using Python and various data science libraries, we explore relationships between student characteristics, environmental factors, and test scores.

## Key Features

- Data exploration and visualization of student performance metrics
- Statistical analysis of factors affecting student scores
- Predictive modeling to understand key influencers of academic performance

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and presentation

## Dataset

The analysis uses the "StudentsPerformance.csv" dataset, which includes information on:
- Student demographics (gender, race/ethnicity)
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type (as a socioeconomic indicator)
- Test preparation course completion
- Scores in math, reading, and writing

## Key Findings

- Significant impact of parental education on student performance
- Positive effect of test preparation courses on scores
- Gender-based performance differences across subjects
- Socioeconomic factors influencing academic achievement
